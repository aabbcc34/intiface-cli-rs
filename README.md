**THIS PROJECT IS NOW DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF [intiface-engine](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-engine)**. Intiface Engine will now be the official CLI and FFI interface to Buttplug Servers.

## Contributing

Right now, we mostly need code/API style reviews and feedback. We
don't really have any good bite-sized chunks to mentor the
implementation yet, but one we do, those will be marked "Help Wanted"
in our [github
issues](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs/issues).

As we need money to keep up with supporting the latest and greatest hardware, we
also have multiple ways to donate!
